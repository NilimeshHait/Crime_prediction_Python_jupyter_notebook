This Project focuses on finding spatial and temporal criminal hotspots. It analyses real-world crime dataset for Denver. Then, it clarifies how we conducted Apriori algorithm to produce interesting frequent patterns for criminal hotspots. In addition, the project shows how I used Naive Bayesian classifier in order to predict potential crime types.
